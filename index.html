        <h2>What Are Number Systems?</h2>
        <p>Number systems are a way to represent numbers. Different systems are used in various contexts based on their efficiency and purpose. The most common number systems include decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.</p>

        <h2>Decimal (Base-10)</h2>
        <p>The decimal system is the one we use in everyday life. It has 10 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Its origin dates back to ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians and Babylonians, likely because humans have ten fingers, making it a natural choice.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Binary (Base-2)</h2>
        <p>The binary system uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. It is the foundation of modern computing and digital technology. The system was formalized by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century, who saw a connection between binary and philosophical concepts of duality.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Hexadecimal (Base-16)</h2>
        <p>The hexadecimal system is commonly used in computer programming and digital systems because it can represent binary numbers more compactly. It uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F, where A represents 10, B is 11, and so on up to F, which represents 15.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The decimal system is intuitive for humans, the binary system powers computers, and the hexadecimal system provides a convenient way to handle binary in a readable form. Together, they form the backbone of number representation in various fields.</p>
