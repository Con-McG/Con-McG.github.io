This is project for CISS 100 where I attempt to create a webpage
Using a combination of tools learned throughout the course I attempt to utalize my HTML and CSS skills from the Web Design unit, combined with the Git tool from Lab 7, to create a website hosted on GitHub that highlights the Data Representation Unit
This project has very breif overviews of Decimal, Binary, and Hexdecimal and their uses
This project is primarily made up of CSS code and some Javascript
I've been using Google's Developer tools to create the website and see changes in real time, when I'm happy with what I have I copy it and commit using git
website can be accessed through https://con-mcg.github.io
